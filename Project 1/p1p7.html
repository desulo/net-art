<h2>The Law of Magnetism</h2>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Game Comes To The Player Who Does Not Try To Pull The Game Towards Himself</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Law 6, known as the Law of Magnetism in the Deep Game Basketball Masterclass, explores the concept of attracting success and opportunities through a mindset of openness and receptivity.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Players who focus on forcing outcomes or trying to control every aspect of the game often encounter resistance and frustration. Conversely, those who trust in their skills, stay present, and allow the game to unfold naturally tend to experience greater flow and success.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Law of Magnetism emphasizes the importance of letting go of attachment to specific outcomes and instead focusing on the process, effort, and positive energy invested in each moment of play.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">To embody this law, athletes cultivate mental resilience, adaptability, and a mindset of abundance. They remain open to learning from every experience, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, and staying connected to the joy and passion that drew them to the game in the first place.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Ultimately, the Law of Magnetism teaches players that success and fulfillment in basketball—and in life—come not from trying to force or control every outcome but from cultivating a magnetic presence that attracts opportunities, growth, and excellence.</p>
